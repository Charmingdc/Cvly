# Cvly: Smart Resume Sharing üìÑ

Welcome to Cvly, a modern web application designed to revolutionize how professionals share their resumes. This project transforms your traditional PDF into a professional, shareable link, offering valuable insights into who views or downloads your work. It's built to empower job seekers and freelancers with intelligent tracking and seamless updates, making sure your application stands out in today's competitive landscape.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get Cvly up and running on your local machine, follow these straightforward steps. It's quick, I promise!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or your preferred package manager like Yarn or pnpm) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Begin by cloning the project to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/cvly
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Move into the newly cloned project folder:

    ```bash
    cd cvly
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install all the required packages for the project. I recommend using npm, but feel free to use your package manager of choice.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage üíª

Once you've installed all the dependencies, you're ready to launch the development server and see Cvly in action!

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, simply run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will compile the project and open it in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. You'll land directly on the captivating main page of Cvly. From there, you can explore the user interface, interact with the different sections like the hero, how it works, and features, and imagine how your own resume would shine using this platform.

## Key Features ‚ú®

Cvly comes packed with features designed to give you an edge in your professional endeavors:

*   **One-Click Shareable Links**: Say goodbye to repeatedly uploading the same file. Cvly generates a single, clean link for your resume that you can share anywhere ‚Äì email, portfolio, or chat.
